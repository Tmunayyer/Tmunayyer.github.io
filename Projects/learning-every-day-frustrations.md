# Frustrations

## Background
I recently embarked on a journey to learn a baseline of Java with a plan to start digging into Kotlin. I felt like learning Java might provide a nice "where it started" perspective and help solidify some aspects of Kotlin.

To hold myself accountable, and to try something new, I started live streaming myself while learning. You can see how I set this up in my first post [here](/Projects/live-stream-learning.html). I also upload every stream to [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@thomasmunayyer7817). This absolutely gave me the motivation I needed to show up every day which in my opinion is by far the most important part.

These videos are raw. I don't edit them. I stream and record simultaneously. As soon as I finish I upload it to YouTube which typically takes about 20-30 minutes for the ~45 minute video.

Theres a few things here to mention that have changed over time:
- when I started I was hyper aware of the camera rolling and probably masking some emotions
- also when I started, I had just come back from a vacation feeling pretty good and motivated, no extra stress in life at all

I think I now have a time horizon long enough (almost 50 days) that things have changed and give me an opportunity to reflect a bit.
## I Get So Frustrated
Now that I am older I can recognize when I am tired or stressed out, but learning every day means learning every day, not just days you feel good. If you pick a random day you might see my cursing and losing my mind because I cannot get the answer to a question correct. Ill sit there and blame the course which is ridiculous (obviously typing this not frustrated) and start questioning why I am even learning this stuff. I think looking back at these days its comical but I really don't want that kind of emotional reaction to learning and struggle.
### Looking Back Further
When I think further back into the past with school, I don't think anyone truly told me that I wasn't supposed to "just know" things. Like its ok to be a beginner in something or to not understand something after it was explained a single time. I realized now that the feeling of struggling was uncomfortable and it caused me to try and get out of it as quickly as possible.

I remember vividly on the SAT getting frustrated after a certain amount of time and I would just guess on a question. I would 100% just stop reading the prompt, stop reading the answers, and just bubble in anything that looked good at the exact moment. I didn't just do this on the SAT, I did this for a lot of tests, especially in classes that I was not interested in. Somehow through my schooling career I only ever failed a single class, and it was an "emotions" class in 6th grade (which is so ironic now as I am writing this, literally laughing out loud) because I thought it was stupid.

Luckily along the way I developed a sort of persistence to make it through. I raised the expectations I had for myself in college and turned things around academically at the very end of that journey.

### Why Is It Uncomfortable
The point I am trying to make in a rambling way and to myself is that I never dealt with why exactly not knowing something caused me physical discomfort to the point that I was trying to escape as quickly as possible.

The fact that I can sit there uncomfortable and super pissed off is great, it means I can still achieve and learn some things but its not the route I want to take. Im not sure what the answer is yet besides a shift in mentality.

Luckily I have the opportunity to do better every day.
