# What
I want to start live streaming myself learning something new.

Right now I am a frontend dev. I know Javascript really well. Reasons why I am going to learn Java are:
- Java is the backend language of choice at work
- I get to take a new language with me if I leave my current job
- Writing more Javascript to get promoted seems like a waste of time. There are only so many ways to write a React component.

I also don't want to spend a bunch of time sifting through various courses. [Hyperskill has a free plan for Java](https://hyperskill.org/study-plan). I forgot how I found it, but without digging deeper, its probably good enough to get started.

I mostly want to focus on the process. Worst case scenario I spin my wheels and never write a single line of production code but end up with a habit of learning.

A successful MVP looks like:
- I can see myself on screen
- I can see the lesson I am working on
- I can easily go live

# How: Twitch
Twitch is the obvious choice based on name recognition. I have tried before to get this set up, but per usual I bailed on it. Not this time. As I am writing the article, **the goal before I close my laptop is to go live and do a single lesson.** Ill worry about capacity and volume later.

## Getting Online
Twitch has a [quick start guide](https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/how-do-i-stream-faq?language=en_US). There is an official client called Twitch Studio that seems to be deprecated and [the Twitch website has no other official desktop client listed](https://dashboard.twitch.tv/u/bored_frontend_dev/broadcast). Lets go with the open source option, [OBS](https://obsproject.com/), for now which seems to be the recommended app on Reddit.
### OBS
Once downloaded it prompted me for permission from my computer in order to enable the camera and audio capture. After that, all I had to do was login to twitch through OBS and it connected. Super easy and this took around 5 minutes.

Now that the OBS application has started, I edited some streaming notes but am only seeing a black screen. Need to find out why my video is not working.

OBS just crashed on me.
#### Sources
In OBS there is a little box to define sources.

I created a new Firefox window, made it full screen (and closed my 1Password window!). I think I can go live now but I did want myself to be on the screen while streaming as an extra "no fooling around" measure. Lets figure that out next. I clicked go live. *I stream therefore I am*.

It turns out you need two sources. The first is your screen and the second is your webcam. After some resizing and more clicking around, I think the MVP is there. I have what I need to start.

# Following Through
Hyperskill lesson number 1.

Done! It turns out you need to hit record after hitting stream in OBS. Lesson learned. Here is a screenshot where you can see that the Hyperskill website is telling me congrats on finishing the first lesson. Next time I will have recorded video evidence.

Thats everything I was looking for today. My learning process MVP is now ready to go, all I have to do is show up.
# Moving Forward
I will continue with Hyperskill's Java course as the topic for now. I will need to setup a scheduled cadence. 

Lets not overthink it and go with 45 minutes every night around dinner time. I want to do more, but I think 45 minutes is plenty to start. Its about the time it takes my rice cooker to finish so I can do it before I eat or after. Once some consistency is built I'll progress to higher volume.
